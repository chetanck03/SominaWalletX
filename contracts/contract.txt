EthEscrow

This project is a simple Escrow Smart Contract built in Solidity that works with ETH (native coin on somina testnet).

How it works ðŸš€

A sender can lock ETH in the contract for a receiver.

The receiver can later claim the ETH.

If the receiver doesnâ€™t claim, the sender can refund their ETH back.

You can also view:

All escrows created by a sender.

All escrows received by a receiver.

Escrow details like amount, status (Pending / Claimed / Refunded), and timestamps.

Main Features âœ…

Create escrow with ETH (msg.value).

Receiver claims ETH securely.

Sender refunds ETH if unclaimed.

Track pending, claimed, and refunded escrows.

Usage Example

Alice creates an escrow for Bob with 1 ETH.

Bob claims â†’ He receives 1 ETH.

If Bob doesnâ€™t claim, Alice can refund her 1 ETH.
